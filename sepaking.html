    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a dashboard and filterable-list structure. The top section provides a visual overview (a doughnut chart) of the question distribution by category. Below this, a primary navigation bar with buttons allows users to filter the list of questions. Each question is presented as a card in a responsive grid. A search bar provides secondary, text-based filtering. This structure was chosen for its intuitiveness; users get an immediate summary and can then drill down into specific categories or search for keywords, making it an efficient tool for targeted practice. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Counts of questions per category. Goal: Inform/Compare. Viz: Doughnut Chart. Interaction: Hover for tooltips showing exact counts. Justification: Provides a quick, scannable overview of the topic balance. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Full list of cue card questions. Goal: Organize/Explore. Presentation: HTML/Tailwind CSS Cards. Interaction: Filtering via category buttons and a search bar. Justification: Cards are easy to read, and filtering is the most direct way for users to navigate to the content they need. Method: Vanilla JS DOM manipulation.
        - All content is organized under clear headings and introductory text to guide the user. The interactive elements directly serve the goal of making a large list of text-based data easily explorable.
